    <p>
      The centre is currently involved in numerous projects i.e donating to the
      needy by donating wheelchairs and providing with food on Mondays and
      Fridays working with other organizations and is involved in doing some
      community services in different areas by cleaning up the areas that can be
      harmful to the community.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the current projects that the centre is involved in it has been able
      to employ more young people, with some participating in sports that the
      centre is also sponsoring which also results in low criminal activities.
      Some people have also acquired certain skills during these projects doing
      some handy works, eg doing plumbing work and also some electrical work
      which also help them to offer their services to some people that need
      these services.
    </p>

    <p>
      The centre has also started with helping school kids by having after
      school programs, helping them with their home works and projects. The
      centre has had some positive support from the communities, which also
      helps the centre to grow and can be able to help and empower more people
      to do good not only for money but for the good and change it brings to
      peoples lives.
