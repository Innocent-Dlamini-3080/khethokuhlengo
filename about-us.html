    <p>
      KHETHOKUHLE CENTRE was discovered by INNOCENT DLAMINI a young man who had
      no family left but<br />
      was driven by hunger to do more in life not just for himself but for other
      people. The aim of <br />the centre is to help people who are in need and
      don’t have anyone to take care of them and also to <br />empower them. The
      centre is hoping to build more facilities in the future to cater for more
      people<br />
      in different regions hoping to archive more with the help of sponsors and
      people who are willing to assist by <br />volunteering and by donating
      with what they have.
